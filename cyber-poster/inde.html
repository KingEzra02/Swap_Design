          <h3>Install Internet Security Software</h3>
          <p>
            Strong cybersecurity starts with installing the strongest antivirus
            software on all of your computing devices. Internet security
            software should also protect your devices from dangerous malware as
            well – which is often used in identity theft crimes. Furthermore,
            you must keep your antivirus software up-to-date. You should also
            scan your computer for viruses and malware each night before turning
            it off.

          <h3>Install a Firewall</h3>
          <p>
            The best way to protect your PC from hackers is to prevent them from
            accessing it to begin with. You can do that by installing a
            firewall. A firewall will block outside attempts to gain access to
            your computer. It can also protect your computer from some viruses,
            malware, and Trojans too. All Windows-based
            computers/laptops/tablets come with the Windows Firewall already
            preinstalled. However, most internet security software programs
            include the option to install a firewall as well.

          <h3>Don’t Open Unknown Email Attachments/Links</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to being a very popular communication medium, email is
            also a very popular way to spread malicious software. Email is
            especially popular for phishing scams – where a user is tricked into
            sharing personal data with identity thieves. You should have your
            internet security software configured to scan every email that you
            receive. Furthermore, you should never open an email attachment nor
            click on any links from an unknown email address. Even if the sender
            looks legit, you should scan all attachments with your internet
            security software before opening them.

          <h3>Install Software Updates</h3>
          <p>
            Hackers are often able to exploit security holes that they find in
            software that runs operating systems and computer programs.
            Therefore, you want to make sure that all of the software you use is
            kept up-to-date. If you have a Windows-based device, you can
            configure your settings to automatically download and install all
            Windows updates. Google and Apple offer automatic updates for their
            devices as well. Most of the computer programs that you use will
            alert you when a new update is available.

          <h3>Disable Hidden Filename Extensions</h3>
          <p>
            Windows-based devices have a security flaw that makes them
            vulnerable to cyber threats. By default, the Windows operating
            system hides file extensions for all known file types.
            Unfortunately, that gives hackers a sneaky way to hide the file
            extensions of their malicious software programs. Therefore, you will
            want to disable that option in Windows. That way you will be more
            likely to notice suspicious file extensions that don’t belong on
            your computer.

          <h3>Turn Off Computer and Disconnect from the Internet</h3>
          <p>
            Last but not least, you don’t have to be actively browsing the
            Internet for your computer to succumb to a cyber-attack. If you
            leave your computer on and connected to the Internet, it’s still at
            risk of cybersecurity threats. Therefore, when you are done using
            your computing device, you need to completely turn it off.
            Furthermore, you should go ahead and disconnect it from the Internet
            to make sure that there is absolutely no way that a cybercriminal
            could access it..
